# FAQ

Let's cover some basics of Emporous.

## What is Emporous?

Emporous is a universal object reference used to generalize multiple streams of content management into a single content management mechanism and strategy.

### Ok, so, what can Emporous be used for?

Didn’t we say anything? A few examples of how Emporous can be used are:

- File Management  
- Hosting static or dynamic web content  
- Labeling and Dataset management  
- [AI model management](https://asciinema.org/a/wWCR7VY0zC97m3ibd3mKXcsJL)
- Infrastructure provisioning and management  
- Storage provider  
- 3D modeling and simulation  
- Secure supply chain management  
- Git provider  
- Container image management  
- Identity management  
- Message broker  
- Package management  
- Literally anything… [You tell us](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/C034YMT1P41).

### Wow, just that list is a lot. And how does Emporous accomplish such flexibility?

Emporous has 4 principles that enable truly universal support for any and all content. Those are:

1. All content is formatted into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
2. All content is a dataset - Every item within a collection of content is labeled.
3. All links to and references to content within a collection of content are performed by an addressing scheme referred to as “Attribute Addressing”. This means that a link or reference to content within a collection is made by referring to that content’s data labels.
4. *Time*, *space*, and *events* must be represented in order to provide truly universal capability. Time and space (state), are represented through content labels. Event representation is performed by executing embedded algorithms stored within each collection of content.

### Did you just say “time, space, and events”?

Yes, Emporous is based on a theory called Object Oriented Ontology. You can learn more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_ontology 

### Why would you want to link something like web pages or any content via attributes?

This might seem arbitrary at first glance, but it is a fundamental concept in human cognition. We describe a table to another person via its attributes i.e. Dark wood, 18x2in rectangular legs, round top... If we’ve been precise enough in our description, another person would be able to pick that table out of a showroom of tables. Emporous takes this concept and applies it to everything. We can then train AI models on a uniformly formatted internet containing contextually linked data. 

### What’s this about embedded algorithms?

Emporous provides a simple way to embed application logic into collections of content. These embedded algorithms are called Universal Runtime Objects (UROs). There are several benefits from this approach such as:  

- Version locked compatibility between application and content.  
- Enables Emporous to be used as a serverless solution  
- Enables 6G technologies: https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/5/4/56/htm  
- When combined with attributes, can be used to express non-tangible concepts (to AI).  
- Provides a decentralization framework

### I’ve seen the word “Attribution” used in Emporous. What does that mean to Emporous?

Attribution in Emporous is a powerful concept. Since anything can be uniformly expressed with Emporous, we can more easily analyze the relationships between elements within an information system and derive intelligence about how those things act upon and influence each other. Those insights become deeper as more elements within an information system are formatted with Emporous.
